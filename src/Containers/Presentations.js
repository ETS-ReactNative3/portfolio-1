            <li>•	Speaking Engagements: a list and links to talks I’ve/I’ll give</li>
            <li>•	Performances: similarly, a list and links to talks I’ve/I’ll give'</li>    
            <li>•	Not entirely sure, up to the creativity of the students but I’m also going to be an instructor at the Blockchain Hub. I’m not sure if this should fall under “Presentations” or “Side-Hustles” since it’s both. I’ll be an instructor of the Certified Blockchain UX Designer course here - theblockchainhub.com/academy. I’m also an instructor on Sklllshare for an online digital product design course (that I need to re-upload higher quality videos for) - https://medium.muz.li/ui-ux-case-study-charity-app-payment-flow-6000e735d2e9</li>
