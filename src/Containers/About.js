                I love product design, blockchain, and social innovation aspiring to become a digital engineer - someone who lies at the cross-section of data, design, and development. I'm a lifelong learner, passionate about exponential-thinking, design-thinking, and systems-thinking. I am what you may call an "innovation-thinker". I'm also a writer, singer, pianist - artist and performer overall; a comforter, philosopher, and lifelong mate. At the end of the day I'm young, scrappy, and hungry makin' it in the big city of the 6ix.
