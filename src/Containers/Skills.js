        Current project (in progress): Timesheet App

        I am currently busy studying the text book (Pro ASP.NET MVC 4 Adam Freeman and Steven Sanderson) and applying the concepts learned to the Timesheet Application.
        
        -	ASP.NET MVC with RAZOR
        -	Using Lambda Expressions
        -	Using Entity Framework to access MSSQL server 
        -	Bootstrap
        
        The project including a back-up of the database can be accessed on Google Drive:
        https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6xaRhDEOQlwR0N4enhpT1ZqMzg
        
        Personal Finance App
        
        Developed using C#, ASP.Net MVC & MSSQL. I currently use the app to keep track of income, expenses, assets and liabilities.
